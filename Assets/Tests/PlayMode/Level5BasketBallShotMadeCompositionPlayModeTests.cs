/// AUD-010 Phase 2b0: closes the same coverage gap
/// <see cref="Level5MoneyBallStateCompositionPlayModeTests"/> and
/// <see cref="Level5ShotMarkerSessionCompositionPlayModeTests"/> close for their own migrations, for
/// <c>BasketBallShotMade.BindMatchContext</c>. Every EditMode test for it
/// (<c>Level5BasketBallShotMadeTests</c>) calls it directly against a hand-built component - proving
/// the binding logic is correct in isolation, but never proving the real <c>GameLevelManager.Awake()</c>
/// -&gt; <c>FindAnyObjectByType&lt;BasketBallShotMade&gt;()</c> lookup actually reaches a live scene's
/// real, scene-authored hoop before any made shot can be scored. That depends on the scene actually
/// containing a <c>BasketBallShotMade</c> and on Unity's own object discovery finding it - neither of
/// which an EditMode test (which builds components directly, never lets a real scene load happen) can
/// observe.
///
/// This drives the real production flow - the same technique the two tests above already use - through
/// the start menu into a real gameplay scene, so the hoop under test is the actual scene-authored
/// <c>basketball_goal</c> object and bound by the actual <c>GameLevelManager.Awake()</c>, not a test
/// double standing in for either.
///
/// AUD-012 Phase 2c Slice 44: bootstrap now goes through <see cref="GameplayScenePlayModeHarness"/>
/// instead of this fixture's own <c>StartManager</c>/<c>Pause</c> handling, so it compiles into
/// <c>Level5.PlayModeTests</c> with no <c>Assembly-CSharp</c> reference. The expected match context is
/// read from the typed <see cref="ActiveMatch"/> the real launch produced (<c>GameLevelManager</c> and
/// <c>MatchRuntime</c> both live in <c>Assembly-CSharp</c> and are unreachable from this assembly, but
/// <c>MatchRuntime.Rules</c>/<c>MatchRuntime.ModeId</c> answer with <c>ActiveMatch.Configuration</c>'s
/// own <c>Rules</c> reference/<c>ModeId</c> exactly whenever a match is active, so asserting against
/// <see cref="ActiveMatch"/> directly is equivalent), not by re-deriving it from the hoop's own binding -
/// so the rules-identity assertion below stays non-circular. The compiler-backed exact-type
/// <c>BasketBallShotMade</c> binding proof stays in EditMode's <c>Level5BasketBallShotMadeTests</c>.
